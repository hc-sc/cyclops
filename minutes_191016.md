Hi all,

Please find below the summary of the kick-off meeting and the action items:

Summary:

-	We went over the scope of the project and the timeline,
-	DSD explained the steps involved in the project: OCR (text detection/recognition), NLP, claim compliance assessment and the web app
-	In addition to DSD’s role, we also talked about the HC’s team involvement, in particular evaluation of the output of the OCR and labeling ingredients, claims, etc
-	We also discussed about the data that we have so far, in addition to a collaboration environment and a communication plan. We have agreed to share small files (images, csvs, snippets, etc) on the Cyclops slack channel (https://remicrapidinnovation.slack.com) and larger files/models on the HC’s github account (https://github.com/hc-sc/cyclops) until we have a shared cloud account.

Action Items:
•	DSD: Continue the OCR on the internal STATCAN cloud and keep HC team in the loop,
•	DSD: Set up weekly meetings with the technical members on both sides. Meetings with the whole group, including the extended members will be on as-needed basis,
•	HC: Continue with taking images of labels and organizing the existing labels by products,
•	HC:  Look into the NHP licensing database for historical claims of NH products with the decision made on them (compliant vs non-compliant),
•	HC: Follow up on a shared working environment (either an azure cloud or epost connect) with external partners.
•	HC: Add the STATCAN users to their github account.

P.S. Please find attached the Cyclops intake form (that includes more details on the scope, deliverables and timeline).

Irshad, don’t you mind sharing with everyone the visio flowchart and its reference document?

Please let me know if I missed anything.
